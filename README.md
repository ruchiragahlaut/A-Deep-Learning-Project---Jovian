# A-Deep-Learning-Project---Jovian

Project Problem -->

Modeling
Define a model (network architecture)
Pick some hyperparameters
Train the model
Make predictions on samples
Evaluate on the test dataset
Save the model weights
Record the metrics
Try different hyperparameters & regularization

Solution --> 

Dataset containing images of dog and cat.
Doing Image classification
Model is predicting whether it's a cat or dog.
Using of pytorch
Loss - F-cross entropy
Number of layers are 4
